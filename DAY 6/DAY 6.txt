DAY 6

#@ Concepts covered - functions, defining and calling a function, while loop and if and else

--> There are two types of functions in python built in functions {len(), int(), float(), max(), set(), list(), etc} and we can create our own functions which is known as defining a function.
--> Once defined a function we can use it by calling the function.
--> If we want to define a function for future and not use now we can write pass under defining the function.


#@ Projects
